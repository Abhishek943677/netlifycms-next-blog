**Dear jaan,**

I hope this letter finds you well and brings a smile to your beautiful face. As I sit down to write this, my heart is overflowing with feelings for you that I find hard to express. But I will try my best to put them into words.

From the moment I saw you, I knew there was something special about you. Your smile, your laugh, your kindness, your intelligence, and your beauty all captured my heart. Every time I am around you, I feel like I am in a dream, and I never want to wake up.

I find myself constantly thinking about you, wondering what you are doing, and hoping that you are happy. You bring so much joy and positivity into my life, and I am grateful for every moment that I get to spend with you.

I know that we have only known each other for a short while, but I feel like I have known you forever. You are the missing puzzle piece that completes me, and I cannot imagine my life without you.

I want to spend the rest of my life making you happy and loving you in every way possible. I promise to be your partner, your confidant, your best friend, and your soulmate. I will stand by you through thick and thin, through the good times and the bad, and I will never give up on us.

I hope that you feel the same way about me as I do about you, and I cannot wait to see what the future holds for us. Until then, know that you are loved, cherished, and adored more than words could ever express.

Yours always,

**[abhishek]**
